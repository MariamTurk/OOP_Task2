# OOP Task 2 ‚Äì C++ Implementation

This repository contains solutions for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment written in C++. The assignment demonstrates core OOP concepts including **inheritance**, **abstraction**, **polymorphism**, and **class hierarchy** through three main questions.

## üîß Project Structure

- **Q1 (Inheritance)**: Implementation of `Vehicle`, `Truck`, and `Bus` classes using inheritance.
- **Q2 (Abstraction)**: Use of abstract class `Movable` and derived class `MovablePoint`.
- **Q3 (Theory)**: Explanation of the differences between Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

| `Q1 (1).cpp`      | Implementation of base class `Vehicle` and its derived classes `Truck` and `Bus`. Demonstrates inheritance and method overriding. |
| `Q2 (1).cpp`      | Abstract base class `Movable` and concrete class `MovablePoint`. Illustrates abstraction and polymorphism via pure virtual functions. |
| `Q3 (1).txt`      | A theoretical comparison of abstract classes vs interfaces. |
